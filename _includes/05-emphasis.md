Write out some of your awesome attributes, and use emphasis (like bold or italics) to identify keywords, programming languages, or skills. 
**My** attributes? Do I really pocess but *one* of them?

Well, English proficiency _might_ count.

Yet nothing could be called __**EXPERT**__ right now...

So how can I make bold **AND** italic emphasis at the same time? Or it's thought unnecessary?
